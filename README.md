# A tutorial website for building a Wordpress web app 

This project was developed to support the University of Exeter Grand Challenges initiative in 2022. The session was designed as a tutorial to give teams an insight into how to build a Web App. The session was designed for non-programmers to walk through configuration and installation of a local Wordpress installation that provides a powerful platform for building web applications to support and prototype the students' ideas for Grand Challenges solutions. 

## User guidance

The tutorial site is hosted through Github pages and can be accessed on the link below. The presentation is designed to accompany the practical tutorial and timings are provided on the overview slides.
